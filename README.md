# EDA_Basics

Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods. EDA helps to understand the data's structure, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through various statistical summaries and graphical representations.

# Learning Objectives
Understand the importance of EDA
Learn how to use Pandas for data manipulation Perform data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn Identify and handle missing values
Detect outliers and understand their impact

# Dataset Description
We will use a hypothetical dataset named FastagFraudDetection.csv. The dataset contains the following columns:
- Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction
- Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction
- Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved in the transaction
- FastagID: Unique identifier for the Fastag
- TollBoothID: Identifier for the toll booth
- Lane_Type: Type of lane (Express or Regular)
- Vehicle_Dimensions: Size of the vehicle (Small, Medium, Large)
- Transaction_Amount: Amount charged for the transaction
- Amount_paid: Amount paid by the vehicle
- Geographical_Location: Latitude and Longitude of the transaction
- Vehicle_Speed: Speed of the vehicle during the transaction
- Vehicle_Plate_Number: License plate number of the vehicle
- Fraud_indicator: Whether the transaction is fraud or not
